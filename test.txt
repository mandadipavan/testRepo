Similar issue:

I gave passphrase when Git-cloned using SSH URL for git.
So this error now shows up, each time I opened VS Code on Windows 10

Below fixed the issue:

1 . Run the below command in CMD

setx SSH_ASKPASS "C:\Program Files\Git\mingw64\libexec\git-core\git-gui--askpass"
setx DISPLAY needs-to-be-defined
